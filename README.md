# Quick-Start-Substrate

[中文 REAMDE](README_zh_CN.md)

Substrate is the foundation platform of polkadot, an engine for the future innocative blockchain. As the most promising edge technology and ecosystem in the blockchain world, it is imperative to learn substrate as soon as possible, whether you are blockchain engineer, Dapp developer or ecosystem developer.

Substrate is increasingly stable even though it's still being in a rapid development. The core team of substrate is trying to improve the documents, but it's far from enough. The scarcity of substrate related learning materials makes the barriers to entry immense at the moment. The ChainX team has dived into the substrate since its birth, it has become the best team in China knowing the Substrate and Polkadot technology. Based on our rich experiences on substrate, we make a cursory summary of learning substrate and this quick start substrate, hoping help the developers interested in substrate from zero to hero.

Given you already have a good knowledge of blockchain basics (at least familiar with the concept of block, transaction, consensus, p2p, signature etc.) as well as some working coding experiences, everyone could master substrate in the following three stages:

- Stage 1:
    - [Lesson 0](https://github.com/chainx-org/Quick-Start-Substrate/blob/master/en/Lesson%200.md) Local two nodes testnet
    - [Lesson 1](https://github.com/chainx-org/Quick-Start-Substrate/blob/master/en/Lesson%201.md) Transfer via blockchain APIs
    - [Lesson 2](https://github.com/chainx-org/Quick-Start-Substrate/blob/master/en/Lesson%202.md) Customize Runtime Module

- Stage 2:
    - Learning Runtime machanism
    - `decl_module` and `decl_stroage` macros
    - runtime module interfaces and storage
    - implement `decl_module` and `decl_stroage` in a new module
    - implement a mini chain adding the litte lucky number game

- Stage 3:
    - staking
    - balances
    - aura + grandpa
    - libp2p
    - rpc
    - contract
    - design a new smart contract blockchain
    - deploy the new smart contract blockchain
